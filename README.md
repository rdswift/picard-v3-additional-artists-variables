# Additional Artists Variables

This plugin provides specialized album and track variables for use in naming scripts. It is based on the
"Album Artist Extension" plugin, but expands the functionality to also include track artists. Note that it
cannot be used as a direct drop-in replacement for the "Album Artist Extension" plugin because the variables
are provided with different names.  This will require changes to existing scripts if switching to this plugin.
